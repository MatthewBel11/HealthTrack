## Introduction
For our project, we selected one of the [17 UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/), focusing on "Good Health and Well-being". Our objective is to create an intuitive Health Diary application to empower users in managing their health effectively.

## Project Objectives
- **User-Friendly Health Diary:** Develop a user-friendly interface for recording and tracking health-related information, including medication schedules, appointments, and personal health data.
  
- **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to remind users about important health-related tasks, such as medicine restock reminders and upcoming appointments.

- **Awareness and Action:** Our aim extends beyond spreading awareness of the importance of good health and well-being. We strive to actively assist users in managing their health and achieving their wellness goals.

## Proposed Features
- **Medication Management:** Provide a platform for users to track their medication intake, receive reminders for prescription renewals, and monitor adherence to treatment plans.

- **Health Alerts:** Deliver real-time alerts for disease outbreaks, health advisories, and relevant medical updates to keep users informed and prepared.

- **Appointment Reminders:** Send timely reminders for upcoming medical appointments, ensuring users never miss important healthcare consultations.

- **Document Storage:** Allow users to securely upload and store medical documents, including vaccine records, lab reports, and other health-related files.

- **Location-Based Services:** Integrate mapping features to help users locate nearby medical facilities such as pharmacies and hospitals. Provide additional information about services offered, hours of operation, and facility ratings.

- **Personalized Profiles:** Enable users to create personalized profiles, including medical history, allergies, and emergency contact information, to tailor the app to their individual health needs.

- **Community Engagement:** Foster a supportive community environment where users can share experiences, exchange health tips, and offer mutual support.

- **Data Privacy and Security:** Implement robust security measures to safeguard users' sensitive health information, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and standards.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Wearable Devices:** Explore opportunities to integrate with wearable health devices to capture additional health metrics and enhance user engagement.

- **Family Care Coordination:** Extend functionality to support care coordination among family members and caregivers, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration in managing health and wellness.

- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly solicit user feedback and iterate on the application to enhance usability, address user needs, and improve overall user satisfaction.

Our project is not just about building an app; it's about making a meaningful impact on the health and well-being of individuals and communities. We're committed to delivering a solution that empowers users to take control of their health and live happier, healthier lives.
